## Why a grammar? {.centered}

<div class="notes">
* Look for 30 seconds. Describe this graph to me in as few words as possible.
    * Is it a line graph? A bar chart? What is it?
* As it was described, would you be able to re-create it?
* Grammar: “the fundamental principles or rules of an art or science” (OED)
* If we develop a grammar, we could answer these questions (although this chart it slightly complex).
* A grammar provides the ability to understand even complex graphs. It also helps us
to understand which charts are well formed.
    * Good grammar is just the first step to a good sentence!

## The basic elements

There are three basic elements of a plot:

<div class="notes">
There are 3 basic elements to a plot:

1. Data: used to make the plot. Typically rows and columns (but not always)
2. Geoms: the visual, geometric objects that are used to represent the data
3. Coordinate system: onto which we place the geoms
    * Typically cartesian for us (XY plane) but could be something more complex
</div>


## Displaying data in a plot

Map variables in the data to the visual properties of the geom: the __aesthetics__.
