## Why a grammar? {.centered}

<img src="./resources/weather-example.png" height="450" width="1000">

<div class="notes">
* Look for 30 seconds. Describe this graph to me in as few words as possible.
    * Is it a line graph? A bar chart? What is it?
* As it was described, would you be able to re-create it?
* Grammar: “the fundamental principles or rules of an art or science” (OED)
* If we develop a grammar, we could answer these questions (although this chart it slightly complex).
* A grammar provides the ability to understand even complex graphs. It also helps us
to understand which charts are well formed.
    * Good grammar is just the first step to a good sentence!
    
> This grammar is useful for both the user and the developer of statistical graphics. For
the user, it makes it easier to iteratively update a plot, changing a single feature at a time.
The grammar is also useful because it suggests the high-level aspects of a plot that
can be changed, giving us a framework to think about graphics, and hopefully shortening the dis-
tance from mind to paper. It also encourages the use of graphics customized to a particular
problem rather than relying on generic named graphics.

## The basic elements {.build}

There are three basic elements of a plot:

<div class="notes">
What are they?

There are 3 basic elements to a plot:

1. Data: used to make the plot. Typically rows and columns (but not always)
2. Geoms: the visual, geometric objects that are used to represent the data
3. Coordinate system: onto which we place the geoms
    * Typically cartesian for us (XY plane) but could be something more complex
</div>


## Displaying data in a plot

Map variables in the data to the visual properties of the geom: the __aesthetics__.

<img src="./resources/basic-mapping.png" height="350" width="900" style="margin:0px auto;display:block">

<div class="notes">
To create a basic plot, we take elements of the data, and _map_ them to aesthetics.

This _translates_ our data into the visual marks present in the data.

It sounds a little obvious at first, but it is important to understand the basic principles at work

Understanding what sorts of data can be mapped to what sorts of aesthetics is crucial for building effective visualisations
</div>

## A simple example

We want a graph of A vs. C, with points representing D, ignoring B.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(A = c(2, 1, 4, 9),
                 B = c(3, 2, 5, 10), 
                 C = c(4, 1, 15, 10),
                 D = c("a", "a", "b", "b"))
knitr::kable(df, align = rep("c", 4))
```

<div class="notes">
What is our data? (Easy)
What is the geom we want?
What are the coordinates? Answer: cartesian (gloss over)

What do we map to what?

At its most basic we need to map:

* A to the x-position aes
* C to the y-position aes
* D to the shape aes
</div>

## A simple example {.centered}

```{r fig.align = 'centre'}
qplot(data = df, x = A, y = C, shape = D, geom = "point", size = I(5))
```

# Graphic Layers

## Building in layers

* Data

<br>

* Mappings

<br>

* Transformations

<br>

* Geometric objects

<div class="notes">
* Transformations = both statistical transformations, _and_ those into coordinate system

* Together, these four components form a 'layer'

* The simple example graph contains just one layer, but plots can have many layers (e.g. the first example)
